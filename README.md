# WriteyDrawey

## Description

An online game inspired by Telestrations or as we called it's informal version in college: "Writey Drawey". Players are given a text prompt which they must draw before time run out. Drawings are passed around and the next players guesses what it is. Repeat until each player has drawn or guessed for each prompt.

## Live

See the app [here](https://writey-drawey.herokuapp.com/).

## Purpose

To learn Phoenix the hard way (by just diving into a project) and to practice building a non-trivial React app from square one.

## Roadmap

:heavy_check_mark: Players can start or join game lobby

:heavy_check_mark: Players can play an infinite game of drawings and guesses

:construction_worker: Game terminates after `[# of Players]` rounds and shows summary

:x: How-to-play page shows rules

:x: Customizable player ordering (defaults to order of joining now)


## Running

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
